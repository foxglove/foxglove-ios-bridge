## About

This app demonstrates how custom data can be streamed to Foxglove using the [Foxglove WebSocket protocol](https://docs.foxglove.dev/docs/connecting-to-data/frameworks/custom/#live-data). The app hosts a WebSocket server; Foxglove connects to the server and requests data to be streamed depending on the [panels](https://docs.foxglove.dev/docs/visualization/panels/introduction/) used.
