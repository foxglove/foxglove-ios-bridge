## About

This app demonstrates how custom data can be streamed to Foxglove Studio using the [Foxglove WebSocket protocol](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/connection/custom#live-connection). The app hosts a WebSocket server; Foxglove Studio connects to the server and requests data to be streamed depending on the [panels](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/panels/introduction) used.
